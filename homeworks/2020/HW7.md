# Homework 7 - Colocalisation and statistical fine mapping

## Task 1. Understanding the basics of fine mapping
1. Perform fine mapping on the CD14 gene expression data. Compare the the 95% credible set to the one obtained from protein expression (fuorescent intensity) data in this tutorial. Hown big are to two credible sets? How many varaints overlap? Do you think it is likely that the CD14 gene and protein expression are regulated by the same causal genetic varaint? Why or why not? How strong to you think the fine mapping evidence is? What other evidence can you take into account (think HW6).

## Task 2. What is the effect of sample size on fine mapping accuracy?
1. Use the ARHGEF3 locus from the CEDAR dataset to test how sample size affects fine mapping accuracy. To to this, start decreasing the sample size by 25 indivuduals and observe how the size of the credible set as well as the the posteror inclusion probabilities change.
2. Look up the ARHGEF3 fine mapped variant from the Open Targets Genetics Portal. In which cell types and tissues can you see the eQTL? What are the traits most strongly associated with this variant? Do these signals also colocalise with the ARHGEF3 eQTL? How strong is the evidence for colocalisation?

## Task 3. Perform fine mapping for the lactase (LCT) gene in the illeum tisssue.
