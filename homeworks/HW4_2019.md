## Task 1: Variance explained and statistical power to detect genetic associations.
**Learning objective**: Understand the relationships between genotype allele frequency, variance explained, sample size and the statistical power to detect genetic associations.

To help you get started with this exercise, I have created a small [example](https://github.com/kauralasoo/MTAT.03.239_Bioinformatics/blob/master/QTL_analysis/simulating_genetic_associations.md) in R to illustrate how we can simulate the effect of genetic variants on gene expression. In your solution you can use either my code snippets or equivalent functions in Python. 

Please the answer the following questions.
