## Task 1: Variance explained and statistical power to detect genetic associations.
**Learning objective**: Understand the relationships between genotype allele frequency, variance explained, sample size and the statistical power to detect genetic associations.

To help you get started with this exercise, I have created a small [example](https://github.com/kauralasoo/MTAT.03.239_Bioinformatics/blob/master/QTL_analysis/simulating_genetic_associations.md) in R to illustrate how we can simulate the effect of genetic variants on gene expression. In your solution you can use either my code snippets or equivalent functions in Python. 

Statistical power of an hypothesis test is the probability that the test rejects the null hypothesis (H0) when a specific alternative hypothesis (H1) is true ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_%28statistics%29)). 

Please the answer the following questions. 

1. Using the code example provided [here](https://github.com/kauralasoo/MTAT.03.239_Bioinformatics/blob/master/QTL_analysis/simulating_genetic_associations.md), estimate the number of samples needed so that the likelihood ratio test (LRT) has 80% power to reject the null hypothesis (p < 0.05) that genotype has no effect on gene expression. Assume that the minor allele frequency (MAF) of the genetic variant is 0.5 and genotype explains 50% of the variance in the gene expression data (the remaining 50% of the variance is due to measurement noise). You can estimate power at a given sample size by generating many (>100) simulated datasets, performing the likelihood ratio test and counting how often is the
